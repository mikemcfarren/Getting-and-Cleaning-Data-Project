## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Mike McFarren


### Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare 
tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

### How to make modifications to this script
Prior to running you will need to make 1 modification to the run_analysis.R file before you are able to process any data:
- Make sure you set your working folder on line 22

### Project Summary

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
